    "- AR (Auo Regressive): the time series is lineraly regressed on its own past value.\n",
    "    - p: the number of past values included in the AR model\n",
    "- I (Integrated): if not stationary, the time series can be differenced to become stationary. \n",

    "Rule of thumb in selecting (p,d,q) values:\n",
    "- IF the PACF plot has a significant spike at lag p, but not beyond and the ACF plot decays more gradually. This may suggest an ARIMA (p,d,0) model.\n",
